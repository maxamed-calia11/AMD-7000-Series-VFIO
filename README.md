## Introduction

In this guide, I aim to share my personal experiences and the techniques I used to get VFIO working with AMD 7000 series GPUs. The process can be complicated, but with patience and the right information, you can achieve a successful setup.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of Linux commands.
- A system with an AMD 7000 series GPU.
- A supported motherboard with IOMMU capability.
- A secondary GPU for the host system (if using passthrough).

## Understanding VFIO

VFIO (Virtual Function I/O) allows direct access to hardware devices from virtual machines. This is particularly useful for gamers who want to run a virtualized OS while maintaining performance akin to native hardware.

### Key Components:
- **IOMMU**: Allows the CPU to directly map devices.
- **QEMU**: An open-source emulator that provides virtualization.
- **KVM**: Kernel-based Virtual Machine enables the Linux kernel to act as a hypervisor.
- **libvirt**: A toolkit to manage virtualization technologies.
  
## Hardware Requirements

1. **CPU**: Ensure your CPU supports virtualization (AMD-V).
2. **Motherboard**: Look for IOMMU support in BIOS/UEFI settings.
3. **GPUs**:
   - Primary: For the host OS.
   - Secondary: For the guest OS.

## Software Requirements

1. **Operating System**: A Linux distribution with kernel version 5.4 or later is recommended.
2. **Packages**:
   - QEMU
   - KVM
   - Virt-Manager
   - libvirt
   - lsof

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: BIOS Configuration

1. Boot into your BIOS/UEFI.
2. Enable **IOMMU** and **VT-d/VT-x**.
3. Save and exit.

### Step 2: Linux Kernel Parameters

Edit your GRUB configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```

Add `intel_iommu=on` or `amd_iommu=on` to the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` line. 

Update GRUB:

```bash
sudo update-grub
```

### Step 3: Install Necessary Packages

Use your package manager to install required packages:

```bash
sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils virt-manager
```

### Step 4: Configure VFIO

Identify your devices using:

```bash
lspci -nn
```

Take note of your GPU and its audio controller.

Next, edit the VFIO configuration file:

```bash
echo "options vfio-pci ids=xxxx:yyyy,xxxx:zzzz" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf
```

Replace `xxxx:yyyy` with your GPU ID.

### Step 5: Load VFIO Modules

Load the modules using:

```bash
sudo modprobe vfio-pci
```

Verify the loading with:

```bash
lsmod | grep vfio
```

### Step 6: Create a Virtual Machine

Open Virt-Manager and create a new virtual machine. 

1. Choose "Local install media."
2. Select your ISO.
3. Assign CPU and memory resources.
4. Add the passthrough GPU in the "Add Hardware" section.

### Step 7: Start the VM

Start your virtual machine and ensure everything works as expected. If issues arise, consult the troubleshooting section.

## Troubleshooting

Common problems you might encounter:

- **Device Not Found**: Ensure IOMMU is enabled and configured correctly.
- **Performance Issues**: Check for GPU usage within the VM and ensure correct drivers are installed.
- **Audio Issues**: Verify that the correct audio device is passed through.
